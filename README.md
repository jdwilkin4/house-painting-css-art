# House painting CSS art

This is a project I created to practice CSS more and challenge myself to create more elaborate CSS art. This was inspired by the [House painting project](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/full-stack-developer/lab-house-painting/build-a-house-painting) found in the Certified Full Stack Developer Curriculum.
